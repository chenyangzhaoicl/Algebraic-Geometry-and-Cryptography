# Algebraic-Geometry-and-Cryptography
My UROP (undergraduate research opportunity program) project at Imperial College London.

This repository includes 2 parts. The first one is the basics of Algebraic Geometry, where I will put some of my study notes here. The second one is Advanced Algebraic Geometry in Cryptography, where I will put my study notes here as well, including the realisation in code (Python).

The project is officially registered at Imperial College London and with bursary included from the department. This is just a record of my study.
